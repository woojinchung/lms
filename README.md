# Stack-augmented Parser-Interpreter Neural Network

This repository contains the source code based on the paper [A Fast Unified Model for Sentence Parsing and Understanding][1] and [original codebase][9]. For a more informal introduction to the ideas behind the model, see this [Stanford NLP blog post][8].


The included implementations are:

- A **Python/Pytorch** implementation of SPINN using a na√Øve stack representation (named `fat-stack`)

## Python code

The Python code lives, quite intuitively, in the `python` folder. We used this code to train and test the SPINN models before publication.

### Installation

Requirements:

- Python 2.7
- Pytorch

Install most required Python dependencies using the command below.

    pip install -r python/requirements.txt

Install Pytorch based on instructions online: http://pytorch.org

### Running the code

The main executable for the SNLI experiments in the paper is [supervised_classifier.py](https://github.com/mrdrozdov/spinn/blob/master/python/spinn/models/supervised_classifier.py), whose flags specify the hyperparameters of the model. You can specify gpu usage by setting `--gpu` flag greater than or equal to 0. Uses the CPU by default.

Here's a sample command that runs a fast, low-dimensional CPU training run, training and testing only on the dev set. It assumes that you have a copy of [SNLI](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) available locally.

    PYTHONPATH=spinn/python \
        python2.7 -m spinn.models.supervised_classifier --data_type snli \
        --training_data_path ~/data/snli_1.0/snli_1.0_dev.jsonl \
        --eval_data_path ~/data/snli_1.0/snli_1.0_dev.jsonl \
        --embedding_data_path python/spinn/tests/test_embedding_matrix.5d.txt \
        --word_embedding_dim 5 --model_dim 10 --model_type CBOW

For full runs, you'll also need a copy of the 840B word 300D [GloVe word vectors](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).

## Log Analysis

This project contains a handful of tools for easier analysis of your model's performance.

For one, after a periodic number of batches, some useful statistics are printed to a file specified by `--log_path`. This is convenient for visual inspection, and the script [parse_logs.py](https://github.com/mrdrozdov/spinn/blob/master/scripts/parse_logs.py) is an example of how to easily parse this log file.

In addition, there is support for realtime summaries using [Visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom). This requires a few steps:

1. Run your experiment normally, but specify a `--metrics_path`.
2. Run Visdom in it's own terminal instance: `python -m visdom.server`
3. Run this project's [visdom_reporter.py](https://github.com/mrdrozdov/spinn/blob/master/scripts/visdom_reporter.py) script, specifying a root which matches the `--metrics_path` flag: `python scripts/visdom_reporter.py --root $METRICS_PATH`

Then open Visdom in a browser window to see graphs representing accuracy, loss and some other metrics updated in real time. This is most useful when running multiple experiments simultaneously.

## Contributing

If you're interested in proposing a change or fix to SPINN, please submit a Pull Request. In addition, ensure that existing tests pass, and add new tests as you see appropriate. To run tests, simply run this command from the root directoy:

    nosetests python/spinn/tests
